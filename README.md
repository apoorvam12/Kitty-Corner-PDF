# Kitty-Corner-PDF
This repo contains a PDF documenting my team's database-backed web application for my Introduction to Databases class. My partner, Sydney Somerfield, and I hosted our web app for this project on our school's private server. Our web app was backed by a MySQL database and aimed to aid in the management of a hypothetical cat shelter, Kitty Corner Cat Shelter. Our app allowed for the implementation of the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions on the various entities (Cats, Fosters, Adopters, etc) within our cat shelter. This PDF documents our project and database outlines, ERD, schema, and UI screenshots of our web app.
